**Type**: Workshop Proposal (Extended Abstract)

## Background & Motivation

Writing assistants powered by LLMs have become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous:
- From grammar checking to auto-completion to full content generation
- Seamlessly integrated into devices (phones, laptops) and software (word processors, email clients)
- Already co-authoring award-winning texts

Building on two prior In2Writing workshops that explored the design space of writing assistants, the organizers argue there's an **urgent need to examine the potential dark sides and harmful effects** of these tools before they manifest.

---

## Research Questions

The workshop facilitates discussion around:

1. **Ethical concerns**: What are the ethical limitations of AI-powered writing assistants?
2. **Writing changes**: How will writing assistants change the way we write (better or worse)?
3. **Cognitive impact**: How will they change the way we think, communicate, and make decisions?
4. **Educational impact**: Do they foster or hinder student learning?
5. **Shared values**: What are our collective visions for writing assistants?
6. **Trade-offs**: How can we navigate tensions between benefits and downsides?

## Method: Workshop Design

### Part 1 - Community Building
- 2-minute lightning talks from participants
- Expert panel discussing dark sides discovered in research/practice
- Connect diverse researchers from HCI, NLP, writing studies, education, legal/labor studies

### Part 2 - Dark Sides Exploration
- Leverage existing design space framework (see below)
- Brainstorm design patterns that could reveal dark sides
- **Speculative design activity** to envision future challenges
- Full-group discussion on consequences and community responses

---

## Design Space Framework

The workshop builds on a comprehensive design space for intelligent writing assistants with **30+ dimensions across 5 categories**:

### Task
- Writing stage (planning, drafting, revision)
- Writing context (academic, journalistic, technical)
- Purpose (expository, narrative, descriptive)
- Specificity (general direction, detailed requirements)
- Audience (specified, implied)

### User
- Demographic profile (age, language & culture)
- User capabilities (writing expertise, efficiency)
- Relationship to system (agency, ownership, trust)
- System output preferences (coherence, diversity)

### Interaction
- User steering the system (explicit, implicit, no control)
- User integrating system output (selection, inspiration)
- UI interface paradigm (text editor, chatbot)
- UI layout (writing area, separated, input UI)
- Visual differentiation (formatting, location)
- Interaction metaphor (agent, tool, hybrid)
- Initiative (user-initiated, system-initiated)

### Technology
- Data source & size
- Model type (rule-based, foundation models)
- Learning approach (supervised, unsupervised, fine-tuning, prompting)
- Output type (analysis, generation)
- Evaluation focus (linguistic quality, controllability)
- Scalability (cost, latency)

### Ecosystem
- Digital infrastructure (usability, interoperability)
- Social factors (stakeholder involvement, social writing)
- Locale (local vs. remote writing)
- Access model (open-source vs. commercial)
- Norms & rules (laws, conventions)
- Change over time (authors, readers, information environment)

---

## Workshop Objectives

1. **Connect diverse community**: Researchers across HCI, NLP, writing studies, and professional practice
2. **Create shared archive**: Document values, goals, and identified dark sides for ongoing reference
3. **Seed collaboration**: Use results as jumping-off point for community collaboration on dark sides prevention

---

## Implications

- Provides researchers **shared awareness of pitfalls** when building writing tools
- Enables **anticipation of risks** before they materialize
- Surfaces **core values** about what writing tools should/shouldn't be
- Establishes **interdisciplinary dialogue** on ethical AI-assisted writing
- Guides research toward desired futures while mitigating potential downsides

---

## Limitations

As a workshop proposal (not empirical research):
- No empirical findings presented (outcomes depend on workshop execution)
- Speculative design approach yields *potential* rather than *confirmed* dark sides
- Primarily community-building; actual prevention strategies emerge post-workshop
- Results dependent on participant diversity and engagement

---

## Key Takeaways for Research

1. **Proactive risk assessment**: Don't wait for harms to manifest—anticipate them through speculative design
2. **Interdisciplinary approach**: Dark sides of writing tools require diverse perspectives (HCI, NLP, education, law, writing practice)
3. **Design space awareness**: Use comprehensive frameworks to systematically identify where harmful effects may emerge
4. **Community collaboration**: Complex ethical challenges require collective effort across institutions and disciplines
5. **Values-first design**: Understanding shared values is prerequisite to building beneficial writing assistants
